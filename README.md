Full README.md coming soon!

This is a Frontend Starter Kit created while going through Pluralsight's "Building a JavaScript Development Environment by Cory House".  This starter kit has some differences from Cory's version due to changes in some of the packages and tools over the past few years.  I've also made my own changes to cater to my style of development.

Released with the ISC license.  Use in any way you want.  Just don't blame me if something catches on fire.
